How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By visibly looking and locating "bugs"

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Allows to avoid previous errors and find potential improvements

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual commits allow to save and keep track of relevant and consistent
    changes in the code. But lack of auto-save feature may cause lose of mods

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To keep consistency across changes made to multiple interrealted files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    To find history of commits in a repo and find mods between any commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Committed mods that include "bugs" can be readily found

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Not only for SW development but also for any other text based documentation
    that needs tracking
